Android applikationen 55 problems - reporting made easy utvecklades i kursen Software Engineering Project (DAT255) på Chalmers Tekniska Högskola av utvecklingsteamet ButAnswersDo beståendes av Vincent Brigel, Anton Kärrman, Anton Ottosson, Axel Rebner, Olof Wireklint och David Åsenhielm. Utveckling skedde under kursens gång under april och maj månad 2016. Applikationen utvecklades i syfte att underlätta felrapporteringen för busslinje 55 som går i Göteborgs busstrafik. Applikationens utformning har baserats på en tydlig vision som tagits fram av projektgruppen och som varit underlag för utvecklingsprocessen.
